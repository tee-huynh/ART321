<div align="left"><h3 style="font-size: 14px"><b style="color:#a27a7a; font-size: 14px;">1. How does the allowed interaction keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches?</b><h3 style="line-height: 20px; text-align: justify">For this interactive narrative, their are quite a few restrictions because you can only use the left and right arrow keys and space bar. There are also only a limited set of things that could be interacted with. Even though this can be quite restrictive, it also keeps the narrative on track because there aren't many ways the player can stray from the path because of the limits placed on the interaction. The goal is never explicitly stated because you start off just doing whatever you want, but the simplistic nature helps to keep the narrative on track and makes sure nothing is too complicated. Any interactions possible are only related to the narrative as well, so there is no chance of really straying from the path. Despite the limitations and the set ending, there are still a lot of variations and branches for how you play it. This includes things like the order in which you do the interactions, how many interactions you choose to do, how many times you want to repeat it, etc. These aspects will be different depending on the player and are unique to each's playthrough. One of the things I liked to do was create different combinations of interactions to see how different things played out, so there were many variations as to what happened depending on what you do first, etc.</h3></div><br/>
<div align="left"><h3 style="font-size: 14px"><b style="color:#a27a7a; font-size: 14px;">2. Describe the nature of the graphical quality and how it is relevant to the story.</b><h3 style="line-height: 20px; text-align: justify">The nature of the graphical quality is minimalistic and very simple and clean. There aren't a lot of details in the art, but you can still tell what things are. It is relevant to the story because the style conveys the same message as the title, "Every Day the Same Dream," which gives off a monotone and bland depiction of a man who lives a boring routine life of waking up, commuting, and going to work. The art style matches this theme of this life where nothing exciting happens, just like in the art how everything is monochromatic colours of mostly black, grey, white. Overall, it is relevant to the story because it helps provide an aesthetic to the theme and carry further/emphasize the simple and monotome idea of the story.</h3></div>

<div align="left"><h3 style="font-size: 14px"><b style="color:#a27a7a; font-size: 14px;">3. Describe the nature of the interaction and how it influences choices and how the player feels. </b><h3 style="line-height: 20px; text-align: justify">The nature of the interaction contributed to the simplistic and linear nature of the game and helped emphasize the main themes. It made me feel a bit unsatisfied with every playthrough because I wanted to do so much more. There were many things I would have loved to interact with. I also felt extremely curious with these interactions because there were so many possible combinations of interactions and orders and I never knew just what one thing could do to affect the story. Would walking out in my underwear alternate the future? How? After my first playthrough, I started to change how I interacted with the game. It influenced my choices because I wanted to explore all the possible endings and variations. I wanted to see how different things would play out if I changed even one thing throughout the story. I repeated the story a lot with little alterations in order to see if I could discover something new within the plot. Every cycle, I was very intrigued. I experienced a few different alternate endings and each were fun to experience. By the end of all my plays, I started to analyze my own little daily interactions throughout my routines and what would happen if I were to change even one little thing. What would happen?</h3></div>
