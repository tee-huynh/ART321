<h3 style="color: #a27a7a"><b>Across the World</b><br /></h3>
<h5 style="font-size: 17px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net art piece I will be designing is essentially a website that displays information about the city and country a visitor (of the site) when they "check in". The goal of this work is to allow people to learn more about different places and cultures around the world.<br /><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will be done by having a "check-in" button where when the user clicks it, their <b>IP address</b> is sent to the website and from there, their country and city location can be found. The website will have a database of information for different countries and will pull out the corresponding data depending on the location of the user, such as what kind of food the country is known for.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This information is then displayed, preferably in an aesthetically-pleasing way, with images and attractive colours. When a user checks into the website, an icon will appear on a map in the country they are checking in from. This will permanently stay on the website and everyone will be able to see the icon. From the icon, anyone looking at the website and click or hover over it for the information and facts about the country the icon is located at.</h5><br />
<h3 style="color: #D1BCE3">Design<br /></h3>
<h5 style="font-size: 17px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this net art piece, the values I will need are mainly the IP address of the person visiting my website when they check in. This will be used for determining the country of where the user is. I would already have the database of country information ready and it would just be a matter of matching this country information with the country data that corresponds with the IP address. This database will be used to find which information to display and it will contain the different types of facts to show the audience. Other assets that will be used are images of the different information of a country. This may include food, flags, culture, media, etc. and may either be hand-drawn images or images found online.</h5>
